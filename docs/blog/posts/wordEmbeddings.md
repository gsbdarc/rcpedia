# Word Embeddings

## What are Word Embeddings?

Word Embeddings are a method to translate a string of text into an N-dimensional vector of real numbers.  Many computational methods are not capable of accepting text as input.  This is one method of transforming text into a number space that can be used in various computational methods.

## An Example

| Word  | "Royalty" Feature | "Masculinity" Feature |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Queen | 0.958123          | 0.03591294            |
| King  | 0.94981289        | 0.92959219            |
| Man   | 0.051231          | 0.9592109321          |
| Woman | 0.0912987         | 0.04912983189         |

Let's say we were to create embeddings for the four words above, with two features representing Royalty and Masculinity.  The resulting embedding for the word "Queen" is <0.958123, 0.03591294> - a value close to 1 for Royalty, and a value close to 0 for Masculinity.  In this example, we could identify the concept of Masculinity by the vector <0,1> and Royalty by <1,0>.

| Word  | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | Feature 4 |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Queen | 0.854712  | 0.32145   | 0.123512  | 0.023051  |
| King  | 0.9521    | 0.23151   | 0.721385  | 0.950213  |
| Man   | 0.12351   | 0.067231  | 0.85921   | 0.821231  |
| Woman | 0.23131   | 0.123151  | 0.011249  | 0.23151   |

However, in real world examples, it is rarely this simple.  In general, we do not know exactly what each of the N features mean.  It is very common to test the quality of embeddings using analogies.  For example, even though we may not be able to identify a feature for Royalty, we expect that subtracting the vectors "King - Man" and "Queen - Woman" should give us roughly the same vector representing Royalty.  similarly for Masculinity, we can test the similarity of the vectors "Man - Woman" and "King - Queen".  

## Common Embedding Models


### Word2Vec
Developed by Google, it uses skip-gram and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) architectures to create word embeddings. [You can read more on Word2Vec's wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec){:target="_blank"} [The Gensim package in python has an implementation of these algorithms](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html){:target="_blank"}.

### GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)
Developed by Stanford, it creates embeddings by aggregating global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus. You can find GloVe and more information [**here**](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/){:target="_blank"}.

### FastText
Developed by Facebook, it extends Word2Vec by representing words as bags of character n-grams, which helps in handling out-of-vocabulary words (words which did not exist in the training data).

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
Developed by Google, it uses transformers to create context-aware embeddings by considering the entire sentence.

### ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)
Developed by Allen Institute for AI, it generates context-sensitive embeddings using deep bidirectional LSTM models.

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
Developed by OpenAI, it generates embeddings using transformer-based architectures, focusing on language generation tasks.

### Universal Sentence Encoder
Developed by Google, it creates embeddings for sentences and paragraphs, useful for tasks like semantic similarity and clustering.

### API's

Many companies offer API's to generate word embeddings.  [Google's Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings){:target="_blank"}, [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings){:target="_blank"}, and [Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=console){:target="_blank"} all offer text analysis services that can generate word embeddings. If you are looking to use more open source embeddings there are model repositories like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models){:target="_blank"} that offer a wide range of models.

## Common Embedding Uses

### Regression and Classification
Word embeddings provide an easy way to translate text into machine learning model inputs. Examples include:

- Sentiment analysis of customer reviews
- Topic classification of news articles
- Stock volatility prediction from SEC filings
- Email spam detection

### Document Clustering
Word embeddings can be aggregated to document level for:

- Finding similar research papers
- Grouping customer support tickets
- Detecting duplicate content
- Organizing large document collections

### Semantic Search
Unlike keyword matching, embeddings enable searching by meaning:

- Finding relevant documents even with different terminology
- Question-answering systems
- Semantic code search

### Information Retrieval
Embeddings improve information retrieval through:

- Semantic similarity scoring
- Query expansion
- Cross-lingual information retrieval

### Transfer Learning
Pre-trained embeddings enable:

- Knowledge transfer between related tasks
- Few-shot learning
- Domain adaptation

### Recommendation Systems
Embeddings power modern recommenders through:

- Content-based filtering
- Item similarity calculation
- User preference modeling

## Implementation Tips
- Consider using pre-trained embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT.
- Evaluate the appropriate embedding dimensionality based on your vocabulary size and the task at hand.
- Consider fine-tuning pre-trained models to better suit your specific task.
