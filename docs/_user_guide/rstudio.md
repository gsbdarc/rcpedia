# RStudio

On the Yens, RStudio is available via JupyterHub. You can access your files and scripts and develop R code in a convenient environment.

!!! warning
    RStudio only has a single version of R. Right now, it is version R/4.3.0.

Launch RStudio from JupyterHub Launcher interface:

!!! danger
    Do **not** install packages directly from RStudio on JupyterHub. Instead, use the terminal and run R to install packages. This ensures compatibility with the Yen environment.

See [this guide](/_user_guide/r#installing-r-packages){target="_blank"} on how to install R packages on the Yens. Make sure the R module you load is the one RStudio is using.
