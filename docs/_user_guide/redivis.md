## What is Redivis?

[Redivis](https://redivis.com/){:target="_blank"} is a powerful data querying and analysis platform built specifically with [researchers in mind](https://redivis.com/for-researchers){:target="_blank"}. Redivis is constructed on top of [Google Cloud's BigQuery engine](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery){:target="_blank"}, which makes working with Big Data on the multi-TB scale much faster. Data manipulation and queries that may take many hours to run on computing systems like the Yens, can take seconds on Redivis.

### Why Redivis?
It has always been a major challenge to find a computing and storage solution for Big Data analysis that is intuitive for less technical researchers while still being powerful enough to 

### Getting Access

The GSB has their own Redivis organization ([**StanfordGSBLibrary**](https://redivis.com/StanfordGSBLibrary){:target="_blank"}) within the greater [Stanford Data Farm](https://redivis.com/Stanford){:target="_blank"} pool of organizations. To join the GSB's Redivis organization, follow [the directions on this page](https://gsb-research-help.stanford.edu/library/faq/358602){:target="_blank"}. After you join the organization, you can start using the datasets that are already available to you and also apply for access to [other datasets that require additional approval](https://libguides.stanford.edu/az.php?q=redivis){:target="_blank"}.

Once you have a Redivis account, you can also join the organization hosted by Stanford Libraries ([**SUL**](https://redivis.com/SUL){:target="_blank"}), which features [an array of datasets](https://redivis.com/SUL/datasets){:target="_blank"} that may be of interest to GSB researchers. Note that the set of datasets in this organization is not maintained by the GSB so you should [contact Research Data Services at SUL](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetdXE6wmr5e7Qdor31lCfl9OLsKRm50Ph08tWJbRkACl9dWg/viewform){:target="_blank"} instead for support.

### Where Do I Start?

To start, Redivis has [extensive documentation](https://docs.redivis.com/){:target="_blank"} about their platform, which even includes [example projects](https://docs.redivis.com/guides/analyze-data-in-a-project/example-projects){:target="_blank"} that discuss specific workflows and use cases.
