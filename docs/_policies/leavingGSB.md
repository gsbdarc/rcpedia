# Leaving GSB & Stanford

For researchers leaving the school, we have developed a collection of policies and best practices to ensure that the appropriate users continue to have access to the right systems and data.

## Your SUNet ID

To start off, please take a look at Stanford's policies on your SUNet ID account for [students](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/accounts/closing-students){target="_blank"} and [faculty/staff](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/accounts/closing-facstaff){target="_blank"}. Within those links, you will find information regarding the grace period for your SUNet account and general directions on how to close any personal websites, transfer AFS data, etc.

## Yen Access

You will lose access to the Yen servers once you are no longer listed as an active faculty, staff, PhD student, research fellow, or postdoc.  If you need access to the Yen cluster after you leave, you will need to have [sponsored access](/_policies/collaborators/){target="_blank"}.  For questions about specific grace periods at the GSB, you will need to inquire with your department in particular.  Note that these grace periods may or may not align with general SUNet grace periods.

## Code/Project Work

If we have helped you on a research project in the past and you would like to have a copy of our work/code, please [contact us](mailto:gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu){:target="_blank"} so that we can share that with you.

## Off-boarding Data

!!! danger "Be Aware of License Agreements"
    Not all data is licensed for use outside of Stanford!  Be careful before copying data to other university environments.

Before copying data, you are responsible for reviewing [Stanford's policies for the Retention of and Access to Research Data](https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/conduct-research/retention-and-access-research-data){:target="_blank"}. Furthermore, if you have signed NDAs or Data Use Agreements for specific datasets, you need to review the terms of those agreements to ensure that copies of the data can be taken outside of Stanford. 


### Data on the Yen Cluster

!!! important "It Is the User's Responsibility to Transition Data Prior to Leaving the GSB"

To provide the best experience for current GSB researchers, the Yen systems have default data lifecycle policies in place for inactive users.

* **Home Directories** are retained for 12 months after the user becomes inactive
* **Project Directories** are retained for 12 months after the Project Owner becomes inactive

This data can be restored on demand, but depending on the data size, may incur an additional fee.

#### Exceptions

Some projects use a disproportionately large amount of data - in these instances, our team may expedite the process of purging this data in the interest of maintaining space for active GSB users.  In these situations, we will work with data owners to ensure this does not result in unacceptable data loss.

If you need more time to identify a home for your data, please [ask us](mailto:gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu){target="_blank"} for help sooner rather than later!

### Data On Other Stanford Systems

For other systems across campus, the data retention and offboarding policies may vary.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your data is accounted for prior to leaving.  Remember that you may have data on the following Stanford-wide platforms:

* Oak
* Sherlock
* Google Drive
* E-mail
* Stanford-owned computers

## AWS

If you've set up an AWS account through University Information Technology, please go to [their cloud storage page](https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_category&sys_id=e6cc5a8813b9aa0019813598d144b09b){target="_blank"} to make an inquiry.

If you use Athena or a custom built cloud solution, it is your responsibility to transition data off of these systems before leaving the school. 

The following may be decommissioned and purged without notice after you leave the GSB:

* Custom built applications, services or websites
* Accounts provisioned specifically for you by DARC
* Unclaimed data on S3 or EBS volumes
