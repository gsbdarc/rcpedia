## Computational Support Policies

Doing computational or data-intensive research can be challenging.  We provide support for all users of our systems to ensure these systems are working as intended and that uses can reach their goals.  While this support is not as extensive as our Faculty-facing Research Project Support, we are able to provide brief consultations on a number of different topics, including:

* Using the [scheduler](/_user_guide/slurm/){:target="_blank"}
* Choosing a [storage location](/_user_guide/storage/){:target="_blank"}
* Parallelizing code
* Selecting a compute platform
* Setting up and querying databases
* Scraping websites

Please [reach out](mailto:gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu){:target="_blank"} to schedule a consultation or ask a question.
