# Acknowledging Us

Researchers who would like to acknowledge the use of the Yens or the consulting services of the DARC team in publications/presentations can do so in the Acknowledgement and/or Methods sections. 

As the DARC team provides both computational support (e.g., use of the `yen` servers) as well as in-depth research support for faculty projects, please identify the specific support you received.

Here are a few sample acknowledgements for the different types of support you may have received from the DARC team:

- The use of Yens:
> Computational Support was provided by the Data, Analytics, and Research Computing (DARC) group at the Stanford Graduate School of Business [(RRID:SCR_022938)](https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_022938/resolver?q=SCR_022938&l=SCR_022938&i=rrid:scr_022938){:target="_blank"}.

- Data gathering:
> Data reported in this publication were acquired with the help of the Data, Analytics, and Research Computing (DARC) group at the Stanford Graduate School of Business [(RRID:SCR_022938)](https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_022938/resolver?q=SCR_022938&l=SCR_022938&i=rrid:scr_022938){:target="_blank"}.

- Research support:
> Research Support was provided by the Data, Analytics, and Research Computing (DARC) group at the Stanford Graduate School of Business [(RRID:SCR_022938)](https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_022938/resolver?q=SCR_022938&l=SCR_022938&i=rrid:scr_022938){:target="_blank"}.

Our preferred citation includes both the full name of our team and the corresponding Research Resource Identifier (RRID). An RRID is a persistent identifier that allows researchers to cite a particular resource used in their work, just as a DOI is used to cite a paper or dataset. If the Yens and the DARC team were used for research that is being published, please use DARCâ€™s RRID (RRID:SCR_022938) to cite us. The use of RRIDs for this purpose is supported by scholarly publishers.
