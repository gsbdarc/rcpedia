# Acknowledging Us

## How to cite the Data, Analytics, and Research Computing (DARC) group at the Stanford Graduate School of Business

Users wanting to acknowledge the use of Yens or our consulting resources in publications could acknowledge the DARC team in the Acknowledgement or Methods section of a publication or presentation. 

As the DARC team provides both computational support (e.g., use of the `yen` servers) as well as in-depth research support for faculty projects, please identify the specific support you received.

Here are a few sample acknowledgements for the different types of support you may have received from the DARC team:

- The use of Yens:
> Computational Support was provided by the Data, Analytics, and Research Computing (DARC) group at the Stanford Graduate School of Business <a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_022938/resolver?q=SCR_022938&l=SCR_022938&i=rrid:scr_022938" target="_blank">(RRID:SCR_022938)</a>.

- Data gathering:
> Data reported in this publication were acquired with the help of the Data, Analytics, and Research Computing (DARC) group at the Stanford Graduate School of Business <a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_022938/resolver?q=SCR_022938&l=SCR_022938&i=rrid:scr_022938" target="_blank">(RRID:SCR_022938)</a>.

- Research support:
> Research Support was provided by the Data, Analytics, and Research Computing (DARC) group at the Stanford Graduate School of Business <a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_022938/resolver?q=SCR_022938&l=SCR_022938&i=rrid:scr_022938" target="_blank">(RRID:SCR_022938)</a>.

Our preferred citation includes both the full name of our center and the corresponding Research Resource Identifier (RRID). An RRID is a persistent identifier that allows researchers to cite a particular resource used in their work, just as a DOI is used to cite a paper or dataset. If the Yens and the DARC team were used for research that is being published, please use the DARCâ€™s RRID (RRID:SCR_022938) to cite us. The use of RRIDs for this purpose is supported by scholarly publishers.
